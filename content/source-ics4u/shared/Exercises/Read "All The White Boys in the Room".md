Mr. Gordon has provided you with an excerpt from the book [Ruined by Design](https://www.ruinedby.design).

This is a chapter from the book, titled "All the White Boys in the Room".

While you are in class today, read and please respond in point-form, on paper, to these prompts:

1. What are some specific ways that innovations (computing or otherwise) have led to harm due to bias in design input?
2. What are some specific actions that can be, and have been taken, to correct for bias in design?
3. What is at least one effect of an innovation you read about that could be viewed as beneficial by one individual, but harmful by another?

Your work will be collected at the end of this period, and returned to you at the start of our next period, to help you prepare for an in-class discussion.
